# ssc

- admin: https://jacogr.github.io/ssc/admin.html (or local http://localhost:8088/admin.html)
- users: https://jacogr.github.io/ssc/index.html (or local http://localhost:8088/index.html)

Addresses (this is a bad idea on live) are derived from a common seed with the username. (So all user-addressing is done via his/her username/e-mail)

- admin logins: `Alice`
- user logins: `<anybody>@<anydomain>`
